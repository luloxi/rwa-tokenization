# Real Estate Demonstration UI

This UI is used for demonstration purposes only. 

This is useful for comparing the on-chain data with the off-chain data. In a production environment, you will need to use a frontend that aligns with your use cases. 

This is simply for the purposes of demonstrating in an educational environment and not designed to help with the issuance or maintanence of a tokenized asset.
